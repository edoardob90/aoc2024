## Explanation of the `search` method of the `Trie` class

Here's the `search` method of the `Trie` class:

```python
def search(self, string: str, debug: bool = False) -> bool:
    n = len(string)
    dp = [True] + [False] * n

    for i in range(n):
        if debug:
            print(dp)

        if not dp[i]:
            continue

        node = self.root
        j = i
        while j < n and string[j] in node.children:
            node = node.children[string[j]]
            j += 1
            if node.is_end:
                dp[j] = True
                if j == n:
                    return True
    return dp[n]
```

Say that we have the following trie â€“ where `*` denotes a a node that marks the end of a pattern:

```
b*
 r*
 w
  u*
g*
 b*
r*
 b*
w
 r*
```

Here's the output when we try to search for the string `brwrr`:

```
Searching for string: brwrr
Initial dp: [True, False, False, False, False, False]

Trying from position 0 (brwrr)
  Looking for patterns:
    Found pattern b -> marking dp[1] = True
    Found pattern br -> marking dp[2] = True
  dp after position 0: [True, True, True, False, False, False]

Trying from position 1 (rwrr)
  Looking for patterns:
    Found pattern r -> marking dp[2] = True
  dp after position 1: [True, True, True, False, False, False]

Trying from position 2 (wrr)
  Looking for patterns:
    Found pattern wr -> marking dp[4] = True
  dp after position 2: [True, True, True, False, True, False]

Trying from position 3 (rr)
  Skipping pos 3 since dp[3] is False

Trying from position 4 (r)
  Looking for patterns:
    Found pattern r -> marking dp[5] = True
  dp after position 4: [True, True, True, False, True, True]

Final dp: [True, True, True, False, True, True]
```

It's crucial to understand what the list `dp` represents: `dp[i] = True` means that we can build the substring `string[0:i]` (where `i` is **not** included, as per Python indexing/slicing rules) using available patterns.

For example, considering the string `brwrr`:

- `dp[0] = True`: can build empty string, which is always possible
- `dp[1] = True`: can build "b" (since we have a pattern "b")
- `dp[2] = True`: can build "br" (since we have a pattern "br")
- `dp[3] = False`: cannot build "brw" because "w" only appears in pattern "wr", never alone
- `dp[4] = True`: can build "brwr" (since we have a pattern "br" + "wr")
- `dp[5] = True`: can build "brwrr" (since we have a pattern "br" + "wr" + "r")
